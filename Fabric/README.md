This section or set of patterns aims to provide a "Fabric Easy Button" for common scenarios. Something that shows how the pieces fit together in easy to deploy templates. Using the **patterns** available here, engineers will be able to quickly setup a Fabric environment which optionally includes streaming & batch ingestion, Data Lake, Delta tables as well as meta-driven pipelines.

## Available Patterns
This repository contains several scenarios, or, 'patterns' for you to deploy into your own environment. Below is a summary:

* **Pattern 1**:  End-to-End Metadata Driven Pipeline in Fabric, From SQL to Staging Lakehouse to Gold Lakehouse
* **Pattern 2**:  End-to-End Metadata Driven Pipeline in Fabric, From SQL to Staging Lakehouse to Data Warehouse
